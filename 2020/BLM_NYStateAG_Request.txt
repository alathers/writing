Hello,
I was led to your complaints e-mail by a post on twitter that is absolutely RIFE with visuals but is starkly lacking and sort of response. 
I realize that part of the value of sending people to the complaints address is that it limits the volume of issues to address; however, given the current climate,
it seems like it would be very helpful to have at least a blanket statement with examples of the actions being taken.

Starting point: https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG/status/1267104053164740609 

The thread is covered with issues such as officers removing masks from citizens who are clearly peaceful and showing their hands to further de-escalate the situation. 
    This means the office is knowingly exposing them to coronavirus and then macing/pepper-spraying them in spite of no physical escalation from the protestors.  
You have officers making hand gestures associated with white supremacy groups.
You have officers driving through crowds.
You have officers shoving citizens at solid objects and curbs to cause serious injury.
You have officers doing drive-by pepper-spray crowds not even directed at groups of protestors.


I found that by way of this video of the Buffalo PD shoving and older person to the ground and then reporting it as "tripped and fell" in spite of the clear video. 
Had the national guard not been present with medics on-site, there's a very solid chance this could have been much worse as I believe the man is reported as recovering now.

I assume you are grossly overwhelmed, but your constituents need to hear your voice.  They need confidence that you are taking action to see these issues addressed both in a 
legally viable but also timely manner.  I recognize that an e-mail address is what works for you, but your constituents need to know you're here. 

They need you to reciprocate and adapt to the platforms they can reach you on.

Please help.  I can help you, please tell me how
